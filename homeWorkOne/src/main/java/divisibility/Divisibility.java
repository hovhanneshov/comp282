package divisibility;

//This program reads in two numbers from the user, dividend and divisor, and prints out whether dividend is evenly divisible by divisor.
//
// For example, one run of the program may look like this:
//
//Enter the dividend: 10
//Enter the divisor: 5
//10 is divisible by 5!
//
//Because 5 goes into 10 twice. 10 is evenly divisible by 5.

//Your program should be able to produce the following output:
//
//Enter the dividend: 10
//Enter the divisor: 0
//10 is not divisible by 0
