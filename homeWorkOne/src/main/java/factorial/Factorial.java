package factorial;
/*
Write a program that prints a factorial to the screen.

The factorial of a number is found by multiplying itself by all positive integers less than it (excluding 0). For example, 4 factorial, written as 4!, can be computed as follows:

4! == 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 == 24
After taking user input for the factorial they want to find, print out the factorial to the console.
Remember to use a for loop! Java does not have a built in factorial operator.
Example Output:
What number would you like to compute the factorial for? 4
24
